# hello-world
I have no idea what I am doing.
I am a young dude who tried out doom mods and wants to know how they work instead of copy pasting them into a source port. 
I am surprised by how interesting this stuff is and want to learn more. Plus, I hear it's a wide open field with tons of opportunity for people willing to do the work. I think that is very cool.
So, here I am just trying to figure this shit out. I dunno what I am going to find. I just want to be challenged by weird puzzels that lead to tangible results when solved. So here we go.
